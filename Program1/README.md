QUESTION :
Given an image I with various fruits (pic.png), perform the following operations:

1.	Create a brightness adjusted image B1 from the image I by adding a constant factor 50 (bright.png).

2.	Convert both images from RGB to HSV color space.  Write your own code to convert from RGB to HSV color space (hsv.png and hsv_bright.png).
3.	Find the “red apple” in each image using both of the following methods and mark the apple with a bounding circle/box . Methods to be used:
      -	Object detection based on color in RGB domain (rgb_detct.png and rgb_bright_detct.png)
      -	Object detection based on color in HSV domain (hsv_detct.png and hsv_bright_detct.png)
4.	Convert the red apple into a green apple and vice versa. (swap.png)


The program was executed on Visual Studio 2013.
In line 365 of the code, set the path of the image accordingly and execute the code.
